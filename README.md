# 👋 Hi, I'm Max

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** with a passion for building smooth, reliable, and user-friendly web experiences.  
My journey started back in **2016**, when I joined a local bootcamp and got my first role in an outsourcing company — trying my best *not to break anything* while learning fast 😄

Since then, I’ve had the chance to:
- Work across multiple projects in outsourcing and product companies  
- Build products with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Vue**  
- Improve **developer experience**, **maintainability**, and **system reliability**  
- Participate in **planning**, **integration**, and **release workflows**  
- Contribute to a great **team culture** — creating a supportive, collaborative, and fun environment

Currently, I’m focused on crafting better UIs and continuously improving my engineering mindset.
